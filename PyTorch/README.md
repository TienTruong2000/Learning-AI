# Convolutional neural network
The implementing of convolutional neuron network with PyTorch

## Getting Started
### Installing
 - Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (recommended python version 3.x.x)
 - Install an IDE (recommended choose one of the following):
	- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
	- [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
 - Other python packages and modules will be instructed further down the course structure
 - Install PyTorch:
	Follow the instruction [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
	Recommed to use pytorch nightly version to work smoothly with tensorboard
 - Install TensorFlow
```
pip install TensorFlow
``` 
 - Download TensorBoard debug [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/master/tensorboard/tools/diagnose_tensorboard.py)
